## Hello! 

I'm a student on the internet who makes (and breaks) things!

I love research and learning new things! I don't really make a particular kind of thing; my projects are usually just whatever seems cool at the time.

## Stuff I've done

### Research

- Coming soon!

### CTFs

- [BlahajCTF 2024](https://av306.github.io/blahajctf-2024-writeups/) :D

- Cyberthon 2025 (we fell off for this one)

### Java

- [Xenon](https://github.com/AV306/xenon): A (now discontinued) Minecraft Fabric utility mod. Features include FullBright, WAILA, crosshair highlighting and more!

- [Blencord](https://github.com/AV306/blencord) and [Potatocord](https://github.com/AV306/potatocord): Two failed attempts at making Discord clients (Blencord only works with bot tokens; I never got around to implementing message sending in Potatocord)

<sub>See LiteCord for an actually successful attempt!</sub>

- [KeybindsGalore Plus](https://github.com/AV306/KeybindsGalore-Plus): A fork of KeybindsGalore with many bugfixes and improvements (originally by Cael and updated to 1.20 by HVB007)

- [LiteConfig](https://github.com/AV306/liteconfig): A small, simple & lightweight reflection-based general configuration library for Java

- [enchantable-heads](https://github.com/AV306/enchantable-heads): A more fully-featured (configurable) version of the original project; released here because my PR never got merged<details>
  <summary></summary>

  <sup>I actually did most of the code research for the original project and came up with the original implementation, but we don't really talk about that</sup>
</details>

- Various PaperMC plugins (I lost most of them when my old pc died)


### C/C++

- [Untitled SFML 2D engine](https://github.com/AV306/engine)

### Web

- [SpeedMath](https://github.com/Craftless/speed-math-qns): Randomly generated (timed) math questions! Made with Node.js, React and Firebase. Collaboration with [Craftless](https://github.com/Craftless), [AustinJason](https://github.com/AustinJason), and Wesley!

- [PaintApp](https://av306.github.io/PaintApp): A basic drawing app with different brush types, shape and text tools. Made in p5.js as a school project.

- [Codebreaker](https://av306.github.io/codebreaker-sentinel/): A (very) basic frequency analyser for simple substitution ciphers. Made for school.

- Documentation and code contributions to [MaxiGames.js](https://github.com/MaxiGames/MaxiGames.js): I'm the "Professional MaxiGames PR Man" on their Discord! (last checked: June 2023)

### Other:
