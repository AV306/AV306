## Hello! 👋

I'm a student and neurodivergent furry programmer (meow :3) who codes and draws sometimes!

I go by the name "Blender" or "diblenderbenzene" (less commonly "AV3_08", "AV306", or some variation depending on availability) on most sites.

<!--
Have some info on my OCs!
  > Blender (my main sona) - Quiet orange tabby cat, loves science (physics in particular) and engineering. A bit socially awkward.
  > Kyra - Fluffy heterochromatic (amber/pale green) blue/purple dragon, data analyst and professional information hoarder. Loves flying. Can't quite breathe fire due to an injury, but occasionally makes little jets of flame when she sneezes.
  > Tachyon (my pfp) - Extroverted, athletic gray/aqua/orange protogen, flies planes. 2 sets of ears. Blender's close friend!
  > Dicot - Green fox, strategist, botanist as a hobby. Also Blender's and Tachyon's friend (of course). He came from a bunch of doodles on my bio notes.

My preferred languages (no particular order):
- Java
- C++ ([engine](https://github.com/AV306/engine) dev was fun!)
- JS / TS (I like `canvas`-based games a lot, because of their universality)
- Python (making http requests by hand is actually quite fun, and ML is cool too ig)
- GLSL (not really a language, but I love shaders)

(please ignore the many empty repos, I'll get around to finishing or deleting them someday, hopefully)

### [My major contribution to OSS](https://github.com/GoulartNogueira/BadUI/issues/1)

<br>

## Stuff I've done

### Java:

- [Xenon](https://github.com/AV306/xenon): A scalable, object-oriented and efficient<sup>\[[citation needed](https://xkcd.com/285/)\]</sup> Minecraft Fabric utility mod written in Java. Features include FullBright, WAILA, croshair highlighting and more!

- [Blencord](https://github.com/AV306/blencord) and [Potatocord](https://github.com/AV306/potatocord): Two failed attempts at making Discord clients  (Blencord only works with bot tokens; I never got around to implementing message sending in Potatocord)

- [KeybindsGalore Plus](https://github.com/AV306/KeybindsGalore-Plus): A fork of KeybindsGalore with many bugfixes and improvements (originally by Cael and updated to 1.20 by HVB007)

- [LiteConfig](https://github.com/AV306/liteconfig): A small, simple & lightweight reflection-based general configuration library

- [enchantable-heads](https://github.com/AV306/enchantable-heads): A more fully-featured (configurable) version of the original project; released here because my PR never got merged (sad) <details>
  <summary></summary>

  <sup>I actually did most of the code research for the original project and came up with the original implementation, but we don't really talk about that</sup>
</details>

- Various PaperMC plugins (I lost most of them when my old pc died)

<br>

### C++

- [Untitled SFML 2D engine](https://github.com/AV306.engine)

<br>

### Web / JS:

- [SpeedMath](https://github.com/Craftless/speed-math-qns): Randomly generated math questions, with a timer to improve mental calculation skills! Made with Node.js, React and Firebase. Collaboration with [Craftless](https://github.com/Craftless), [AustinJason](https://github.com/AustinJason), and Wesley!

- [PaintApp](https://av306.github.io/PaintApp): A basic drawing app with different brush types, shape and text tools. Made in p5.js as a school project.

- [explore.js](https://av306.github.io/explore.js): Minecraft 2D, but you can't mine or craft. Work in progress. May never be finished.

- [Pet Da Fox (aka Blu Petting Simulator)](https://av306.github.io/petdafox): Pet the fox! A ~~very useless~~ PopCat-like thing based on an animation by [@blufoxery](https://instagram.com/blufoxery)

- [math](https://github.com/AV306/math): Some math helper tools, mostly for graphics stuff

- [Codebreaker](https://av306.github.io/codebreaker-sentinel/): A basic frequency analyser for simple substitution ciphers. Made for the Sentinel Programme (school thing). Very low effort :(

- Documentation and (one) code contributions to [MaxiGames.js](https://github.com/MaxiGames/MaxiGames.js): I'm the "Professional MaxiGames PR Man" on their Discord! (last checked: somewhere in June 2023)

- [2D engine](https://av306.github.io/2d-engine-p5js): A ~~very unreliable~~ basic 2D game engine made in p5.js, with sprites, physics and rudimentary circle colliders. Made to pass the time during lessons.

<br>

### Other:

- [xkcd-qol](https://github.com/AV306/xkcd-qol): Extension that adds stuff to XKCD comic pages ("Explain" button linking to `explainxkcd`, quick-jump-to-index button)

- [web-qol](https://github.com/AV306/web-qol): Extension adding stuff to some pages, especially Google Translate ("slash" to select text input, backspace-when-unfocused to clear text input...)

- [Some interesting shaders](https://av306.github.io/interesting-graphics)

- [cp](https://github.com/AV306/cp): [codebreaker.xyz](https://codebreaker.xyz) solutions, mostly copied from editorials
