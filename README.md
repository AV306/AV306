## Hello! 👋

I'm a student and neurodivergent orange cat on the internet who codes and draws sometimes!

I go by the name "Blender" or "diblenderbenzene" (less commonly usernames satisfying the regex `AV3[_]?0[68]`) on most sites.

<sub>Username regex concept inspired by [azazo](https://azazazo.github.io/about/) :D</sub>

I love research and generally learning new things! I don't really make a particular kind of thing; my projects are usually just whatever seems cool at the time.

<!--

Preferred languages (no particular order):
- Java (yes, this was my first language. In hindsight, that may not have been the best idea, but hey, it works)
- C++ (for when I don't want a TenplateVertexBufferConsumerFactoryManager, for some reason)
- JS / TS (I like `canvas`-based games a lot - they're so universal and mostly *just work*)
- Python (pwntools cool)
- GLSL (not really a language, but I love shaders)

(please ignore the many empty repos, I'll get around to finishing or deleting them someday, hopefully)

  <summary></summary>

  <sup>I actually did most of the code research for the original project and came up with the original implementation, but we don't really talk about that</sup>
</details>

- Various PaperMC plugins (I lost most of them when my old pc died)
